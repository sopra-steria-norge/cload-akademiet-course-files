# Add authentication to your API (using Microsoft Authentication Library in Swagger) - HOW TO

## Starting branch
[ef-core](https://github.com/sopra-steria-norge/WhoOwesWhat-Net48/tree/ef-core)


What we are going to do in this part of the course:
- Add middleware in Program.cs (using Swashbuckle and config to set up Swagger)
- Add configuration & variables for identity in appsettings.json
- Decoration on controllers using the `[Authorize]` filter
- Application registration in Azure (we have already created this --> URL)


##  Steps
- Open branch ef-core
- Launch app
- Try Sync endpoint, should get 200 OK (since we're using an unprotected API)
- Add Nuget packages with `CLI` or `Package Manager` (Swashbuckle.AspNetCore (probably in your project already), Microsoft.Identity.Web)
- Add section AzureAd to `appsettings.json` and populate based on the identity we've already created --> url to app reg.
- Add authentication middleware (`builder.Services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(builder.Configuration);` `app.UseAuthentication();`)
- Add decorators to controllers using the `[Authorize]` filter
- Launch app try Sync endpoint again (should get 401 Unauthorized, the API is now protected by authentication)
- Configure Swagger UI to use interactive authentication (use builder to register Service, get values from AzureAd section in appsettings and make the app use SwaggerUI with OAuth)
- Launch application and authenticate using the padlock button - should now be able to log in
- Try Sync endpoint - should now work (200OK) since you're able to get a bearer token and authenticate
