# Add authentication to your API (using Microsoft Authentication Library in Swagger) - HOW TO

## Starting branch
[ef-core](https://github.com/sopra-steria-norge/WhoOwesWhat-Net48/tree/ef-core)


What we are going to do in this part of the course:
- Add middleware in Program.cs (using Swashbuckle and config to set up Swagger)
- Add configuration & variables for identity in appsettings.json
- Decoration on controllers using the `[Authorize]` filter
- Application registration in Azure (we have already created this --> URL)

## Before we start doing changes, make sure that your WhoOwesWhat solution is built successfully and that the API returns 200 (OK)
- Build solution (F6) and launch app (F5)
- Try the endpoint `POST User/CreateUser` with some mock data of your choosing, should get a 200 (OK) response (since we're currently using an unprotected API)
- Make sure the `personGuid` is unique in the CreateUser request

## Add the neccessary NuGet packages to your project
- Add Nuget packages with `CLI`, `Package Manager` or right-click on solution and select `Manage NuGet Packages for Solution...`
- Required packages:
-- `Swashbuckle.AspNetCore` (probably in your project already, install required only if not already there)
-- `Microsoft.Identity.Web`

## Use the built-in `Task list` in Visual Studio to locate the TODO's in your solution

## TODO: 1. Finish UserCredential Entity

##  Steps

- Add section AzureAd to `appsettings.json` and populate based on the identity we've already created --> url to app reg.
- Add authentication middleware (`builder.Services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(builder.Configuration);` `app.UseAuthentication();`)
- Add decorators to controllers using the `[Authorize]` filter
- Launch app try Sync endpoint again (should get 401 Unauthorized, the API is now protected by authentication)
- Configure Swagger UI to use interactive authentication (use builder to register Service, get values from AzureAd section in appsettings and make the app use SwaggerUI with OAuth)
- Launch application and authenticate using the padlock button - should now be able to log in
- Try Sync endpoint - should now work (200OK) since you're able to get a bearer token and authenticate
